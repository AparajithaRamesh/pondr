This package aims at providing an efficient workflow for extracting, formatting and analyzing data from RFID readers in the context of studying animal behaviour using an experimental approach. A schematic version of this vignette is available in the *StalkeR cheat sheet*. Eventually, the package allows researchers to compute behavioural indices for each individual, such as a shoaling index and an activity index.

First, you can (install and) load the *StalkeR* package.

```{r setup}

install.packages("pondr")
library(pondr)

```

# Format data

## What is an experimental block?

Before starting to use the *StalkeR* package functions, you have to format and organize your data in a certain way. The unit of the *StalkeR* package is a data frame containing *reads* for one *experimental block*. This means that in the data frame, every row is one read, containing information about the individual id, the antenna and the exact time of the read. An *experimental block* represents a unit limited in *space* and *time*, with associated antennas. For instance, if you work with birds, an experimental block can be one enclosure with several animals. If you work with fishes, an experimental block might be a pond/aquarium containing a group of fish. To obtain reads from one experimental block, we suggest to use the following workflow.

## Building a reference list per experimental block (`block_ref_df`)

First, you should build the `block_ref_df` data frame. This object contains a list of all the individuals of one experimental block. In addition, several covariates can be added to the data frame, *e.g.* sex, size or experimental treatment. The data frame *must* contain at least the *id* columns with the individuals identification code/number.

```{r}

# I import the example data frame
data(block_ref_df)

# I show the first rows of this example
head(block_ref_df)
```

## Building the `raw_df` object

Then, depending on your experimental set-up, there are two options: (i) the data frame(s) you obtain from your RFID readers contain reads already corresponding to experimental blocks (one data frame per experimental block); (ii) the data frame(s) you obtain from your RFID readers contain reads from several experimental blocks (one data frame for several experimental block).

If you are in the first case, you can move to the 'Format `raw_df`' section below. If you are in the second or the third case, you will need to subset of assemble the reads corresponding to your different experimental blocks first.

### Format `raw_df`

You must be now working with a data frame containing reads from one experimental block. This data frame must contain at least four different columns: *id*, *date*, *time* and *antenna*. The *id* column must contain a unique number/code per individual; the *date* column must contain the data at the dd-mm-yy format;the *time* column must contain the time in the hh:mm:ss format; the *column* must contain a unique antenna number/code. Be sure to name these columns as in the example below, keeping in mind that R is case sensitive (no capital letters in columns name).

```{r}
# I import the example data frame
data(raw_df)

# I show the first rows of this example
head(raw_df)
```

Now that `block_ref_df` and `raw_df` are ready, you can start to use the different package functions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Clean the data

The first function has to be used before using any of the next *StalkeR* functions. It uses the `block_ref_df` and `raw_df` objects as inputs, and outputs a cleaner version of `raw_df` named `block_df`. The function does the following actions:

-   It keeps the columns of interest (*i.e.* id, antenna and time).
-   The time format is changed to *Posixt* format.
-   It keep one read per individual at a certain antenna per second (*i.e.* remove repeats).
-   It remove ghost reads test reads, or any read that do not correspond to individuals present in the `block_ref_df` object.
-   It orders the data frame based on time.

The output, `block_df`, is the working unit of this package.
