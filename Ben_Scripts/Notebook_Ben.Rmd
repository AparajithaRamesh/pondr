title: "Behavioural tests"
output:

---

This notebook contains chunks of R script computing indices for five different behaviours:

- Traveled distance
- Tendency to spend time at the top of the pond
- Latency to cross an exploration box
- Tendency to hide
- Shoaling tendency

There is no specific behavioural test for the last index. Instead, the metric is retrieved from the data collected in the four other tests. This notebook is so far written to compute the individuals behavioural indices for one week of treatment, from the four weekly data sets.

## 1. Packages, data import and basic data manipulation

I first import the packages I will use in in the notebook.

```{r, results="hide", message = FALSE}

# Packages
  library(dplyr)  
  library(tidyr)
  library(tibble)
  library(lubridate)
  library(ggplot2)
  library(readr)
  library(data.table)
  library(patchwork)
  library(stringr)
  library(readxl)
  library(micropan)
  library(plotly)
  library(qdapTools)
  library(arsenal)
  library(cowplot)
```

I import the four data sets we obtain every week, one for each behavioural test. I also import the list of all the fishes, with their corresponding pond and *treatment sequence* (i.e. PP, PM, MP, MM, where P stands for 'Plus predation treatment' and M for 'Minus predation treatment'.

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Exploration box data
EB_df <- read_delim("Data/Week 1/20201102.CSV", 
     ";", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)

# Bottom antennas data
bottom_df <- read_delim("Data/Week 1/20201103.CSV", 
     ";", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)

# Top antennas data
top_df <- read_delim("Data/Week 1/20201105.CSV", 
     ";", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)

# Shelters data
shelter_df <- read_delim("Data/Week 1/20201104.CSV", 
     ";", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)

# List of fish
  list_fish <- read_excel("~/Cours/M2 - Sticklebacks/Data/1. Preliminary tests/4. Week -1/Ben_PITtag_final_grouped_FINAL.xlsx", 
                          sheet = "Sheet1")

```

Below, you will find a series of generic functions, that can be applied to one of the data sets imported above (i.e. data frame containing the reads for one test during one day). These functions can be applied to data sets coming from the four different tests.



#### 1.1 _clean.data_ Function

I create the **clean.data** *function*. This function does the following things:

- It subsets a few columns of interest from the raw data (i.e. time, antenna, id)
- It keeps only one read per individual and per second for a given antenna (i.e. remove repeats)
- It assigns every individual to a category named *time of the day*, indicating if the fish was tested during the morning or during the afternoon.
- It renames the antenna as *1, 2, 3 and 4* (see Fig 1 & Fig 2). Therefore, antenna numbers in all ponds correspond to their respective position.
- It removes the ghost reads, and the reads coming from antenna tests, only to keep the fish reads in the ponds.
- It assigns each individual to its *pond number* and *treatment sequence*.

![Figure 2 - Location of the antennas for the *top* and the *EB* tests.](C:/Users/benka/OneDrive/Documents/Cours/M2 - Sticklebacks/Meetings/Meeting 7 - Last practical details/Practicalities/Slide9.png)



```{r, message = FALSE}
clean.data <- function(df){

# Naming my columns
  names(df) <- c( "Identifier", "Date", "Time",
                  "Unit.number", "Antenna.number", "Transponder.type",
                  "Transponder.code", "Weight", "Input.status",
                  "Output.status", "Event", "GPS.coordinates")


# Defining my variables
  df$Identifier <- as.integer(df$Identifier)
  df$Time <- as.character(df$Time)
  df$Unit.number <- as.integer(df$Unit.number)
  df$Transponder.code <- as.character(df$Transponder.code)
  df$Actual_time <- dmy_hms(paste(df$Date,df$Time,sep=" "))

  
  
# I make a new data frame with a subset of the variables of interest here
  new_dataset<-subset(df, select=c(Actual_time, Unit.number, Transponder.code))
  names(new_dataset) <- c("time", "antenna", "id")
  new_dataset <- new_dataset  %>% distinct()
 
  
   
# I assign every individual to a group (Morning/Afternoon)
  x = as.POSIXct(strptime(c("090000","121500","190000"),"%H%M%S"),"UTC")
  date(x) <- new_dataset$time[1]

  new_dataset$time_of_day <- case_when(
    between(new_dataset$time,x[1],x[2]) ~"Morning",
    between(new_dataset$time,x[2],x[3]) ~"Afternoon")
  
  
  
# I rename my antennas with a similar notation across ponds (see scheme above)
    new_dataset[new_dataset == 11 | new_dataset == 21 | 
                  new_dataset == 31 | new_dataset == 41] <- 1
    new_dataset[new_dataset == 12 | new_dataset == 22 | 
                  new_dataset == 32 | new_dataset == 42] <- 2
    new_dataset[new_dataset == 13 | new_dataset == 23 | 
                  new_dataset == 33 | new_dataset == 43] <- 3
    new_dataset[new_dataset == 14 | new_dataset == 24 | 
                  new_dataset == 35 | new_dataset == 34 | 
                new_dataset == 44] <- 4
    

# I remove all the reads that do not come from the fish present 
# in the ponds (e.g. ghost reads, test reads).
# I first identify the reads that do not  come from the ponds
    ghost_reads <- setdiff(new_dataset$id, list_fish$id)

# I remove all of them from the data frame
    for (i in 1:length(ghost_reads)){
    new_dataset <- new_dataset[!(new_dataset$id == ghost_reads[i]),]
    }
    
# Now, if I run this line, I should obtain a value equal or smaller than 200.
#    length(unique(new_data set$id))    
    
# I assign every individual to its pond and treatment category
    new_dataset <- merge(new_dataset, list_fish[c(2,8,9)], by = "id")
    
  
  
  return(new_dataset)
  }

```



#### 1.2 _Nb.ind_ Function


Next, I make a small function to obtain, for each clean data frame, the number of individuals in the pond.

- Input = A clean data frame (see _clean.data_ function.)
- Output = A data frame containing then number of individuals that were read per pond, and the total number.

```{r}

Nb.ind <- function(clean_df){
  
# I separate my data set per Pond
  ponds <- split(clean_df, f = clean_df$Pond)

# I define a vector
  ponds_df <- c()
# For each pond...
  for (i in 1:length(ponds)){
    # ... I want to obtain the number of individuals.
    ponds_df[i] <- length(unique(ponds[[i]]$id))
    
  } # end of loop

# I make a data frame with the loop output
  ponds_df <- data.frame(Pond = c(1:8), Nb = ponds_df)
  ponds_df[9,] <- c("Tot", sum(ponds_df$Nb))
    return(ponds_df)
  } # end of function

```


#### 1.3 _miss.ind_ Function


Then, I write another small (and very similar) function to obtain the identity of these missing individuals.

- Input = A clean data frame (see _clean.data_ function.)
- Output = A data frame containing the individuals that were not read, and their corresponding pond number.

```{r}

  miss.ind <- function(clean_df){
    
 # I separate my data set per Pond
  ponds <- split(clean_df, f = clean_df$Pond)
  
  # I define a list 
  miss_ind_pond <- list()
  
  
  # For each pond...
  for (i in 1:length(ponds)){
     # I want to obtain the individuals that are in the list of fish and that were not read
     # in the pond.
     miss_ind_pond[[i]] <- setdiff(unique(subset(list_fish$id, list_fish$Pond == i)),
                                  unique(ponds[[i]]$id)
    )
  } # end of loop
  # I obtain a list, each object is a vector containing the id of the missing individuals
  # I make this list a vertical df
    miss_ind_pond <- list2df(miss_ind_pond)
  # I change the order of the columns
    miss_ind_pond <- data.frame(miss_ind_pond$X2, miss_ind_pond$X1)
  # I rename the columns
    names(miss_ind_pond) <- c("Pond", "missing_id")
  
  return(miss_ind_pond)
  }
  
```


Next, I can apply these generic functions to the different data sets (at the start of the next sections). The four following sections also contain chunks of code to specifically analyse the data from the four different tests, respectively. 

---

## 2. Latency to explore the box
### 2.1 Data manipulation

I first clean my data set, and look how many fish are missing and what their identity is. I show three data frames: (i) the cleaned data frame, (ii) the number of individuals per pond, (iii) the identity of the missing fish.

```{r, message = FALSE}
  EB_clean_df <- clean.data(EB_df)
  print(EB_clean_df)  
  Nb.ind(EB_clean_df)
  
  EB_missing <- miss.ind(EB_clean_df)
  print(EB_missing)
  
  
# I split my dataframe into a list of dataframes (one object per individual)
   EB_list_df_id <- split(EB_clean_df, f = EB_clean_df$id)

```

Next, I make a data frame with the characteristics of all individuals, even the ones that haven't been read this day. To do so, I use the _Fish list_ imported above.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# I merge the clean data frame with the variables data drame
  EB_variables <- merge(list_fish[,c(2, 8, 9)], 
                      unique(EB_clean_df[,c(4,5)]), by = "Pond")
# I remove duplicated rows
  EB_variables <- EB_variables[!duplicated(EB_variables[,c('id')]),]

# I must obtain a value of 200.
  length(unique(EB_variables$id))


```

Now, we want to know how long individuals take to fully cross the box. To obtain this metric, I need to first define the crossing sequences and starting times.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# I indicate the crossing sequences (antennas 1 -> 4 and 4 -> 1)
  p1.4 = c(1, 2, 3, 4)
  p4.1 = c(4, 3, 2, 1)

# I define my starting times
  start_morning = as.POSIXct(strptime(c("093000"),"%H%M%S"),"UTC")
  date(start_morning) <- EB_clean_df$time[1]
  
  start_afternoon = as.POSIXct(strptime(c("123000"),"%H%M%S"),"UTC")
  date(start_afternoon) <- EB_clean_df$time[1]
```

---

### 2.2 Antenna changes

Next, I want to keep the reads corresponding to antenna changes. For each individual, if an individual has been read at the antenna the following way (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3), we only keep the first reads for each sequence of identical numbers. The output is, for the example above: 1, 2, 3. 


```{r, message = FALSE}
  

  # I define my objects
    df_list_red <- list()
    nb_ind <- length(EB_list_df_id) # number of individuals that have been read by the antennas

    
    
  # For each individual, I want to obtain the reads corresponding to an antenna change and the
  # corresponding antenna number, time and fish id.
    for (i in 1:nb_ind) {
      EB_list_df_id[[i]] <- EB_list_df_id[[i]][order(as.POSIXct(EB_list_df_id[[i]]$time)),]
      changes          <- which(EB_list_df_id[[i]]$antenna!= lag(EB_list_df_id[[i]]$antenna))
      antenna          <- c(EB_list_df_id[[i]]$antenna[1], EB_list_df_id[[i]]$antenna[changes])
      time             <- c(EB_list_df_id[[i]]$time[1], EB_list_df_id[[i]]$time[changes])
      id               <- c(EB_list_df_id[[i]]$id[1], EB_list_df_id[[i]]$id[changes])
      df_list_red[[i]] <- data.frame(antenna, time, id)
    }


    
    
  # I bind the rows of the list (i.e. make it a data frame, as it initially was)
    EB_Changes <- bind_rows(df_list_red)
    EB_Changes <- as.data.frame(EB_Changes)
    EB_Changes <- merge(unique(EB_clean_df[c(1,4,5,6)]), EB_Changes, by = "id", all = FALSE)

  # EB_Changes is basically the initial 'df' but the repeated reads
  # have been eliminated only to keep the first one.


    
    ```

---
    
### 2.3 Latency to cross the box

#### 2.3.1  _first.cross_ Function

Once I have the antenna changes, I can start to look at which sequence of changes I am specifically interested in. To do so, I build a function which has, as:

- Input = A data frame containing the antenna change reads for one individual
- Output = The first full cross of the exploration box, or an empty data frame if the individual hasn't fully crossed the box.

```{r, message = FALSE}

first.cross <- function(df){
  
  # I identify all the row numbers at which the individual started the sequential
  # crossing between antenna 1 and antenna 4
  rowstarts_1234  <- unlist(gregexpr("1234", paste(df$antenna, collapse="")))
  
  
  
  # If the individual has crossed the box from antenna 1 to antenna 4.
  if (rowstarts_1234[1] != -1){
  
  # Then, I subset the first full box cross (1,2,3,4)
    first_cross_1234 <- df[sort(c(outer(rowstarts_1234[1], (0:3), "+"))), ]
  # I make it a horizontal table  
    first_cross_1234 <- first_cross_1234 %>% spread(antenna,time)
    first_cross_1234 <- as.data.frame(first_cross_1234)
    names(first_cross_1234) <- c("id", "time_of_day", "Pond", "Treatment_seq", 
                                 "Ant1", "Ant2", "Ant3", "Ant4")
    }
  
  
  
  # On the other hand, if the individual hasn't crossed the box from antenna 1 to antenna 4.
  if (rowstarts_1234[1] == -1){
  # Then I just obtain an empty tibble.  
    first_cross_1234 <- tibble( )}
 
  
  
  # Same as above but between antenna 4 and antenna 1. 
    rowstarts_4321  <- unlist(gregexpr("4321", paste(df$antenna, collapse="")))
  if (rowstarts_4321[1] != -1){
  first_cross_4321 <- df[sort(c(outer(rowstarts_4321[1], (0:3), "+"))), ]
  first_cross_4321 <- first_cross_4321 %>% spread(antenna,time)
  first_cross_4321 <- as.data.frame(first_cross_4321)
  
  
  names(first_cross_4321) <- c("id", "time_of_day", "Pond", "Treatment_seq", 
                               "Ant1", "Ant2", "Ant3", "Ant4")}
  if (rowstarts_4321[1] == -1){first_cross_4321 <- 
    tibble( )}
  
    
  # I rbind my two tibbles.
  first_cross <- rbind(first_cross_1234, first_cross_4321)
  # In summary, I either obtain:
  # (i) A two-rows data frame containing the first cross of the focal ind 
  # for the two sequences.
  # (ii) A one-row data frame containing the first cross of the focal ind
  # if it only crossed the box in one direction.
  # (iii) An empty data frame if the individual never crossed the box.
   
  
  
  # If the individual did at least one full cross...
  if(dim(first_cross)[1] != 0){
  # Then, I subset its first full cross.
    first_cross <- first_cross[order(first_cross$Ant2),]
    first_cross <- first_cross[1,]}
  
  
  # On the other hand, if the individual hasn't fully crossed the box...
  if(dim(first_cross)[1] == 0){
  # Then, I just obtain a data frame with NAs.
      first_cross <- data.frame(id = df$id[1], Ant1 = NA,
                   Ant2 = NA, Ant3 = NA, Ant4 = NA)}
  
    
  return(first_cross)} # end of the function


```



Next, I can apply the function above to all individuals. I also add a column containing the latency to fully explore the box. 

```{r, message = FALSE}

# I split my data frame per individual
  EB_changes_list <- split(EB_Changes, f = EB_Changes$id)


# I define a list
  first_crosses <- list()

  
# For each individual...
  for(i in 1:length(EB_changes_list)){
    # I want to obtain the first full cross of the box, using the function defined above.
    first_crosses[[i]] <- first.cross(EB_changes_list[[i]])
  }
  
  
# I bind the data frames of my list together to obtain a single data frame containing
# The first cross of all individuals that crossed the box.
  EB_Lat <- bind_rows(first_crosses)


  
# I add a new column with the time to cross the box since the start of the test
# For the morning
  EB_Lat_morning <- mutate(subset(EB_Lat, time_of_day == "Morning"), 
                           time_since_start = difftime(Ant2, start_morning, units='m'))
# For the afternoon
  EB_Lat_afternoon <- mutate(subset(EB_Lat, time_of_day == "Afternoon"), 
                             time_since_start = difftime(Ant2, start_afternoon, units='m'))

  
# I bind the two, and transform my column (in minutes) as numerical
  EB_Lat <- rbind(EB_Lat_morning, EB_Lat_afternoon)
  EB_Lat$time_since_start <- as.numeric(EB_Lat$time_since_start)



```


#### 2.3.2  _finalise.EB_ Function

I make a small function, to modify my data frame containing the crossing sequence of all individuals that crossed the box in a way that I have a nice data frame for plotting. In this function, I add the individuals variables (i.e. pond, Time of the day, treatment sequence, hereafter _variables_). Finally, I give the maximal value (that is, 150 minutes) to all individuals that never crossed the box.


```{r, message = FALSE}


finalise.EB <- function(EB_Lat, EB_variables) {
# I add the environmental variables
  EB_Lat_final <- merge(EB_Lat[c("id", "time_since_start")], 
                        EB_variables[c('id', "time_of_day", "Pond", "Treatment_seq")], 
                        by = 'id', all = T)

  
  
# I assign the maximal values to all the fish that never crossed the box.
  EB_Lat_final$time_since_start[is.na(EB_Lat_final$time_since_start)] <- 150

  
  
# I create an exploration index, for which a low value means that individuals never 
# explored the box, and a high value means that individuals explored it early.
  EB_Lat_final$Expl_index <-  abs(c(EB_Lat_final$time_since_start - 150))

  
  
# I only keep the variables of interest for plotting.
  EB_Lat_final <- EB_Lat_final[c("id", "Pond", "Treatment_seq", 
                                 "time_since_start", "time_of_day", "Expl_index")]
  
  return(EB_Lat_final)}


```

I use the _finalise.EB_ function to clean up the output and to obtain a plottable data frame.

```{r}
# I run the finalise.EB function defined above to clean my output
  EB_output <- finalise.EB(EB_Lat, EB_variables)

# I clean my environment
  rm(EB_Changes, EB_Lat,  
  EB_Lat_morning, EB_Lat_afternoon, 
  first_crosses, EB_changes_list, 
  df_list_red, EB_list_df_id)

```

### 2.3 Plotting

The histogram below shows the distribution of latencies to explore the box. All fish that did not entirely cross the box received the maximal score.

```{r, message = FALSE}
  
ggplot(data = EB_output, aes(time_since_start)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(),
                   bins = 20,
                   fill="#6f7b96",
                   colour = "white") +
    labs(x="Latency to explore the box (minutes)", y="Count") +
    theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f7f5f5")) + ggtitle("Latency to explore")
  
```

The plots below show the distribution of latency scores per pond and per treatment sequence. 


```{r, message = FALSE}

    ggplot(data = EB_output, aes(x = Treatment_seq, y = time_since_start, fill = time_of_day)) + 
      geom_violin(position = position_dodge(width = 0.4)) + 
      
      #geom_boxplot(width=.1, outlier.alpha = 0.1, 
      #             position = position_dodge(width = 0.4), colour = "black") +
      
      scale_fill_brewer(palette="Blues") +
      
      # theme_bw() +
      theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(colour = "#d4d4d4"),
            panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
            panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour = "#e6e6e6"), 
            axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), 
            axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), 
            panel.background = element_blank(),
            axis.line.y = element_line(color = "black")) +
      labs(y = "Latency to explore the box (minutes)", x =" ") +
      scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0,NA)) + ggtitle("EB")


    ggplot(data = EB_output, aes(x = Treatment_seq, y = time_since_start)) + 
      geom_violin(fill = "#e4e3e8") + 
      geom_boxplot(fill = "white", width = 0.07, outlier.alpha = 0.3) +
      theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(colour = "#d4d4d4"),
            panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
            panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour = "#e6e6e6"), 
            axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), 
            axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), 
            panel.background = element_blank(),
            axis.line.y = element_line(color = "black")) +
      labs(y = "Latency to explore the box (minutes)", x =" ") +
      scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0,NA)) + ggtitle("EB")
```

## 3. Travelled distance
### 3.1 Data manipulation


I first clean my data set, and look how many fish are missing and what their identity is. I show three data frames: (i) the cleaned data frame, (ii) the number of individuals per pond, (iii) the identity of the missing fish.

```{r, message = FALSE}

  bottom_clean_df <- clean.data(bottom_df)
  print(bottom_clean_df)
  Nb.ind(bottom_clean_df)
  
  bottom_missing <- miss.ind(bottom_clean_df)
  print(bottom_missing)
  
```


I make a data frame with the characteristics of all individuals, even the ones that haven't been read by the antennas this day.

```{r, message = FALSE}

# I merge the clean data frame with the variables data drame  
  bottom_variables <- merge(list_fish[,c(2, 8, 9)], unique(bottom_clean_df[,c(4,5)]), by = "Pond")

# I remove duplicated rows  
  bottom_variables <- bottom_variables[!duplicated(bottom_variables[,c('id')]),]

# I must obtain a value of 200.  
  nrow(bottom_variables)
  


```


I define the distances between the different antennas, and the sequence of crossing corresponding to these distances.

```{r, message = FALSE}
    # Distances between antennas
    pond.width   <- 1
    pond.length  <- 1.1

### 3.2 _trav.dist_ - A function computing the travelled distance per individual

First, as above, I want to keep the reads corresponding to antenna changes. For each individual, if an individual has been read at the antenna the following way (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3), we only keep the first reads for each sequence of identical numvers. The output is, for the example above: 1, 2, 3. 

Second, I compute the traveled distance between these antennas, for every change, and sum them up. At the end, I will obtain a proxy for the distance that a fish has traveled between the antennas during 2:30 hours.


```{r, message = FALSE}
    trav.dist <- function(new_dataset){
    
    # I split my data frame into a list of data frames (one object per individual)
    df_list <- split(new_dataset, f = new_dataset$id)



##  1. REMOVE THE REPEATED READS AND OBTAIN THE ANTENNA CHANGE

    # I define 'df_list_red', which will be 'df_list' with only antenna changes
    df_list_red <- list()
    nb_ind <- length(df_list)

    
    # I obtain the output vectors and the associated time
    for (i in 1:nb_ind) {
      changes          <- which(df_list[[i]]$antenna!= lag(df_list[[i]]$antenna))
      antenna          <- c(df_list[[i]]$antenna[1], df_list[[i]]$antenna[changes])
      time             <- c(df_list[[i]]$time[1], df_list[[i]]$time[changes])
      id               <- c(df_list[[i]]$id[1], df_list[[i]]$id[changes])
      df_list_red[[i]] <- data.frame(antenna, time, id)
    }

    
    # I bind the rows of the list (i.e. make it a data frame, as it initially was)
    df2 <- bind_rows(df_list_red)
    df2 <- as_tibble(df2)
    # df2 is basically the initial 'new_dataset' but the repeated reads in an identical 
    # sequence have been eliminated.

    
    # I obtain the number of times each individual was read in two different antennas consecutively
    Changes <- sapply(df_list_red, nrow)
    id <- numeric() # Individual names
    for(i in 1:length(df_list_red)){
      
      id[i] <- df_list_red[[i]][1,3]}

    # I can generate a data frame with number of changes per individual
    df3 <- data.frame(id, Changes)


## 2. DISTANCE TRAVELLED BY EACH INDIVIDUAL

    # A for loop calculating the total distance traveled by each individuals between the antennas it's been read at
    
    # I define my Dist numerical vector
    Dist <- numeric()
    
    for (i in 1:length(df_list_red)){
      # I make three numerical vectors, each for a distance type (i.e. width/length/diagonal)
      # Each element of this vector is the number of times an individual achieved the pattern above
      # E.g. width = c(4, 2, 3, 7) corresponds to an individuals crossing 4 times 11->12, 2 times 12->11,
      # 3 times 13->14 and 7 times 14-13.
      width <- str_count(paste(df_list_red[[i]]$antenna, collapse=""), seq.width)
      length <- str_count(paste(df_list_red[[i]]$antenna, collapse=""), seq.length)
      diagonal <- str_count(paste(df_list_red[[i]]$antenna, collapse=""), seq.diag)

      
      # I obtain the achieved distance per distance type (i.e. width/length/diagonal)
      dist.width <- sum(width)*pond.width
      dist.length <- sum(length)*pond.length
      dist.diagonal <- sum(diagonal)*pond.diagonal
      
      # Total distance
      Dist[i] <- (dist.width + dist.length + dist.diagonal)
    } # end of for loop

    # Total distance travalled by all individuals
    df4 <- cbind(df3, Dist)
    
    return(df4)
    }

```


I run the function and obtain, for every individual, the distance it travelled between all the antennas it's been read at. However, some individuals might not have been read at all. Therefore, I add the individuals that, potentially, haven't been read and indicate their travelled distance as 0.

```{r, message = FALSE}
bottom_output <- trav.dist(bottom_clean_df)

# I check if individuals might have not been recorded at all by the antennas
    non_read_babies <- setdiff(list_fish$id, bottom_output$id)
    non_read_babies <- data.frame(id = non_read_babies, Changes =  0, Dist =  0)
    
# Final df containing the read (and potential non-read) individuals
    bottom_output <- rbind(bottom_output, non_read_babies)
    
# Clean environment
    rm(non_read_babies)
```




---

### 3.3 Plotting

First, I will, for every individual, indicate to what pond and treatment it is associated with.

```{r, message = FALSE}
    

# I assign every individual to its pond and treatment category
    bottom_output <- merge(bottom_variables, bottom_output, by = "id", all = T)

```


```{r}
ggplot(data = bottom_output, aes(Dist)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(),
                   bins = 50,
                   fill="#6f7b96",
                   colour = "white") +
    labs(x="Travelled distance", y="Count") +
    theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f7f5f5")) + ggtitle("Distance")
```


Violin plots (with mean and SD) showing all treatment sequences and the time of the day:


```{r, message = FALSE}
  # Violin plots for differences between the 8 ponds within a week
      ggplot(data = bottom_output, aes(x = Treatment_seq, y = Dist, fill = time_of_day)) + 
      geom_violin(position = position_dodge(width = 0.4)) + 
      
      geom_boxplot(width=.1, outlier.alpha = 0.1, 
                   position = position_dodge(width = 0.4), colour = "black") +
      
      scale_fill_brewer(palette="Blues") +
      
      # theme_bw() +
      theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(colour = "#d4d4d4"),
            panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
            panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour = "#e6e6e6"), 
            axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), 
            axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), 
            panel.background = element_blank(),
            axis.line.y = element_line(color = "black")) +
      labs(y = "Travelled distance (meters)", x =" ") +
      scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0,NA)) + ggtitle("Distance")


    ggplot(data = bottom_output, aes(x = Treatment_seq, y = Dist)) + 
      geom_violin(fill = "#e4e3e8") + 
      geom_boxplot(fill = "white", width = 0.1, outlier.alpha = 0.3) +
      theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(colour = "#d4d4d4"),
            panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
            panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour = "#e6e6e6"), 
            axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), 
            axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), 
            panel.background = element_blank(),
            axis.line.y = element_line(color = "black")) +
      labs(y = "Travelled distance (meters)", x =" ") +
      scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0,NA)) + ggtitle("Distance")
```




## 4. Tendency to hide
### 4.1 Data manipulation

I first clean my data and check who's missing.

```{r, message = FALSE}
  shelter_clean_df <- clean.data(shelter_df)
  print(shelter_clean_df)
  Nb.ind(shelter_clean_df)
  
  shelter_missing <- miss.ind(shelter_clean_df)
  print(shelter_missing)
  
# I split my dataframe into a list of dataframes (one object per individual)
   shelter_list_df_id <- split(shelter_clean_df, f = shelter_clean_df$id)

   
```

### 4.2 Duration spent at each antenna

Next, I make a data frame with the characteristics of all individuals, even the ones that haven't been read by the antennas this day. To do so, I use the Fish list imported above.

```{r, message = FALSE}
shelter_variables <- merge(list_fish[,c(2, 8, 9)], 
                      unique(shelter_clean_df[,c(4,5)]), by = "Pond")


shelter_variables <- shelter_variables[!duplicated(shelter_variables[,c('id')]),]

```

Then, I simply want to obtain the number of reads per fish. As only one read per individual is kept per second, this will be an approximation for duration spent read by the antennas.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# I define the objects
  nreads <- c()
  ids <- character()
# For each individual...
  for (i in 1:length(shelter_list_df_id)){
    # ...I obtain its name...
    ids[i] <- shelter_list_df_id[[i]]$id[1]
    # ... and its number of reads.
    nreads[i] <- nrow(shelter_list_df_id[[i]])
    
    } # end of for loop
  
# I merge these two vectors together
shelter_output <- data.frame(id = ids, nb = nreads)

# and clean my environment
rm(ids, nreads, shelter_list_df_id)


```



For every individual, I indicate to what pond and treatment it is associated with.

```{r, message = FALSE}
    

# I assign every individual to its pond and treatment category
    shelter_output <- merge(shelter_variables, shelter_output, by = "id", all = T)
    shelter_output[is.na(shelter_output)] <- 0    
    shelter_output$duration_shelter <- shelter_output$nb/60


```



### 4.3 Plotting


```{r}
ggplot(data = shelter_output, aes(duration_shelter)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(),
                   bins = 20,
                   fill="#6f7b96",
                   colour = "white") +
    labs(x="Duration spent hiding", y="Count") +
    theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f7f5f5"))  + ggtitle("Hiding")
```



```{r}
 
 # Violin plots for differences between the 8 ponds within a week
ggplot(data = shelter_output, aes(x = Treatment_seq, y = duration_shelter, fill = time_of_day)) + 
      geom_violin(position = position_dodge(width = 0.4)) + 
      
      geom_boxplot(width=.1, outlier.alpha = 0.1, 
                   position = position_dodge(width = 0.4), colour = "black") +
      
      scale_fill_brewer(palette="Blues") +
      
      # theme_bw() +
      theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(colour = "#d4d4d4"),
            panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),

      labs(y = "Time spent hidin (minutes)", x =" ") +
      scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0,NA)) + ggtitle("Hiding")



    ggplot(data = shelter_output, aes(x = Treatment_seq, y = duration_shelter)) +
      geom_violin(fill = "#e4e3e8") +

      labs(y = "Time spent hiding (minutes)", x =" ") +
      scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0))  + ggtitle("Hiding")
    
    
```

## 5. Time spent at the top of the water column

### 5.1 Data manipulation

I first clean my data and check who's missing.

```{r, message = FALSE}
  top_clean_df <- clean.data(top_df)
  print(top_clean_df)
  Nb.ind(top_clean_df)
  
  top_missing <- miss.ind(top_clean_df)
  print(top_missing)
  
# I split my dataframe into a list of dataframes (one object per individual)
   Top_list_df_id <- split(top_clean_df, f = top_clean_df$id)

   
```

### 5.2 Duration spent at each antenna

Next, I make a data frame with the characteristics of all individuals, even the ones that haven't been read by the antennas this day. As there are some ponds in which no fish were read for the 'Top' test, I manually enter which ponds were tested during the morning and during the afternoon. 

```{r, message = FALSE}
top_schedule <- data.frame(Pond = c(4, 2, 5, 6,  # Morning ponds
                                    1, 3, 7, 8), # Afternoon ponds
                          
                           time_of_day = c("Morning",  "Morning", "Morning", "Morning",
                                          "Afternoon", "Afternoon", "Afternoon", "Afternoon"))

top_variables <- merge(list_fish[,c(2, 8, 9)], 
                      top_schedule, by = "Pond")


top_variables <- top_variables[!duplicated(top_variables[,c('id')]),]

```


```{r, message = FALSE}


# I define the objects
  nreads <- c()
  ids <- character()
  
# For each individual...  
  for (i in 1:length(Top_list_df_id)){
    # ...I obtain its name...
    ids[i] <- Top_list_df_id[[i]]$id[1]
    # ... and its number of reads.    
    nreads[i] <- nrow(Top_list_df_id[[i]])
  }# end of for loop

# I merge these two vectors together
  top_output <- data.frame(id = ids, nb = nreads)

# and clean my environment
  rm(ids, nreads, Top_list_df_id, top_schedule)
  

```


I indicate, for every individual, to what pond and treatment it is associated with.

```{r, message = FALSE}
    

# I assign every individual to its pond and treatment category
    top_output <- merge(top_output, top_variables, by = "id", all = T)
    top_output[is.na(top_output)] <- 0    
    top_output$duration_top <- top_output$nb/60


```


### 5.3 Plotting



```{r}

## 5. Shoaling index


I want to obtain the proportion of time that each individual spends with at least one conspecific, as a proxy for shoaling/social tendency. To do so, I first wish to know how many times each individual was read at the same time than at least another fish at a certain antenna (hereafter named *accompanied reads*, or *AR*). Then, I simply divide this number by the total number of reads.

To reach this goal, I write two functions:

### 5.1 _shoaling.index.pond_ Function

This function has, as an:

- Input n°1 = A clean data frame containing all the reads (for a certain test) at one pond.
- Input n°2 = The variables of all the fish present in this pond.
- Output = A data frame containing all the individuals (and not only the ones that were read) of this pond, and for each of them, their number of accompanied reads, and their total number of reads.

```{r}



shoaling.index.pond <- function(clean_df_pond, df_variables){
  
  #clean_df_pond <- subset(bottom_clean_df, Pond == 1)
  #df_variables <- subset(bottom_variables, Pond == 1)
  
  # If an individual has been read at the top in this pond
  if (nrow(clean_df_pond != 0)){
  
  # I split my data frame into a list of dataframes (one object per individual)
  clean_df_2 <- split(clean_df_pond, f = clean_df_pond$antenna)
  
  # I define a list
  accompanied_reads <- list()
  
  # For each antenna...
  for (i in 1:length(clean_df_2)){
    # If an individual has been read in this antenna
    if (nrow(clean_df_2[[i]] != 0)){
        
    # I subset all the time points for which more than 1 individuals were read at one antenna
    accompanied_reads[[i]] <-  clean_df_2[[i]] %>% group_by(time) %>% filter(n() > 1)
    
    # I count the number of accompanied reads per individual
    accompanied_reads[[i]] <- accompanied_reads[[i]] %>% group_by(id) %>% add_tally()
    # I remove duplicated rows
    accompanied_reads[[i]] <- accompanied_reads[[i]][!duplicated(accompanied_reads[[i]][,c('id')]),]
    }
    }
  
  
  # I bind the rows of the list of dataframes
  accompanied_reads <- bind_rows(accompanied_reads)
  
  # I keep the total number of accompanied reads in all antennas
  accompanied_reads <- accompanied_reads %>%
    group_by(id) %>%
    mutate(tot_acc_reads = sum(n))
  
  
  
  # I remove the 'n' column, useless now
  accompanied_reads <- accompanied_reads[,- c(7)]
  # I remove duplicated rows
  accompanied_reads <- accompanied_reads[!duplicated(accompanied_reads[,c('id')]),]
  
  # Now, I want to take into account the total number of reads of each individual as well
  clean_df_pond <- clean_df_pond %>% group_by(id) %>% add_tally()
  clean_df_pond <- clean_df_pond[!duplicated(clean_df_pond[,c('id')]),]
  clean_df_pond <- merge(df_variables, clean_df_pond[c("id", "n")], by = "id", all = T)
  clean_df_pond[is.na(clean_df_pond)] <- 0
  
  # I add them to the data frame with the accompanied reads
  accompanied_reads <- merge(clean_df_pond[c("id", "Pond", "time_of_day", "Treatment_seq", "n")], 
                             accompanied_reads[c("id", "tot_acc_reads")], by = "id", all = T) 
  names(accompanied_reads)[5] <- "tot_reads"
  accompanied_reads[is.na(accompanied_reads)] <- 0
  return(accompanied_reads)
  
  } # end of the first 'if'
  
} # end of function

```


### 5.2 _shoaling.index._ Function

This function is using the function just above, but for an entire dataset, and not just one pond.

- Input n°1 = A clean data frame containing all the reads (for a certain test) at *all* pond.
- Input n°2 = The variables of *all the fish*.
- Output = A data frame containing all the individuals (and not only the ones that were read), and for each of them, their number of accompanied reads, their total number of reads, and the accompanied reads divided by the total reads, (i.e. shoaling index).


```{r}

  # Example data frames
  #clean_df <- bottom_clean_df
  #variables_df <- bottom_variables


shoaling.index <- function(clean_df, variables_df){
# I define my objects
  variables_per_pond <- list()
  clean_df_list <- list()
  list <- list()
  
  # For each Pond
  for (i in 1:8){
    # I split my data frame per pond
    clean_df_list[[i]] <- subset(clean_df, Pond == i)
    # I split my variable df by pond
    variables_per_pond[[i]] <- subset(variables_df, Pond == i)
    
    # If fish were read at this pond...
    if (nrow(clean_df_list[[i]]) != 0){
    
    # ... Then apply the function defined above, and obtain the reads 
    # and accompanied reads per individual. 
    list[[i]] <- shoaling.index.pond(clean_df_list[[i]], variables_per_pond[[i]])  
    } 
    
    # If however no fish was read in this pond
    if (nrow(clean_df_list[[i]]) == 0){
    # Then my data frame has 0s for total number of reads and accompanied reads
    list[[i]] <- data.frame(variables_per_pond[[i]], tot_reads = 0, tot_acc_reads = 0)
    } 
  }
  
  # I bind the rows of my list, and obtain a long data frame
  Shoaling_index <- bind_rows(list)
  # I create my Shoaling index by dividing acc. reads by tot. reads.
  Shoaling_index$shoaling <- Shoaling_index$tot_acc_reads/Shoaling_index$tot_reads

```


I apply the function to the cleaned data sets.

```{r}

  shoaling_EB <- shoaling.index(EB_clean_df, EB_variables)
  shoaling_bottom <- shoaling.index(bottom_clean_df, bottom_variables)
  Shoaling_top <- shoaling.index(top_clean_df, top_variables)
  shoaling_shelters <- shoaling.index(shelter_clean_df, shelter_variables)

```




```{r, message = FALSE}



a <- ggplot(data = shoaling_EB, aes(shoaling)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(),
                   bins = 20,
                   fill="#6f7b96",
                   colour = "white") +
    labs(x="Proportion of a time with at least one conspecific", y="Count") +
    theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f7f5f5")) +
  xlim(c(0,0.6)) +
  ylim(c(0,65)) + ggtitle("EB")

b <- ggplot(data = shoaling_bottom, aes(shoaling)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(),
                   bins = 20,
                   fill="#6f7b96",
                   colour = "white") +
    labs(x="Proportion of a time with at least one conspecific", y="Count") +
    theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f7f5f5")) +
  xlim(c(0,0.6)) +
  ylim(c(0,65)) + ggtitle("Bottom")

c <- ggplot(data = Shoaling_top, aes(shoaling)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(),
                   bins = 20,
                   fill="#6f7b96",
                   colour = "white") +
    labs(x="Proportion of a time with at least one conspecific", y="Count") +
    theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f7f5f5")) +
  xlim(c(0,0.6)) +
  ylim(c(0,65)) + ggtitle("Top")

d <- ggplot(data = shoaling_shelters, aes(shoaling)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(),
                   bins = 20,
                   fill="#6f7b96",
                   colour = "white") +
    labs(x="Proportion of a time with at least one conspecific", y="Count") +
    theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f7f5f5")) +
  xlim(c(0,0.6)) +
  ylim(c(0,65)) + ggtitle("Shelter")

((a + b) / (c + d))
```



Then, I want to put all of these indices together in one data frame.

```{r}
# I take merge all the columns of interest from the four outputs obtained above.
  shoaling_output <- cbind(shoaling_EB[c("id", "Pond", "time_of_day", "Treatment_seq", "tot_reads", "tot_acc_reads")],
                         shoaling_bottom[c("tot_reads", "tot_acc_reads")],
                         Shoaling_top[c("tot_reads", "tot_acc_reads")],
                         shoaling_shelters[c("tot_reads", "tot_acc_reads")])

# I rename the columns  
  names(shoaling_output) <- c("id", "Pond", "time_of_day", "Treatment_seq", "tot_reads_EB", "acc_reads_EB",
                           "tot_reads_bottom", "acc_reads_bottom",
                           "tot_reads_top", "acc_reads_top",
                           "tot_reads_shelters", "acc_reads_shelters")

# I make a new columns summing all the accompanied reads  
  shoaling_output$ACC_READS <- shoaling_output$acc_reads_EB + shoaling_output$acc_reads_bottom + 
                                shoaling_output$acc_reads_top + shoaling_output$acc_reads_shelters

# I make a new columns summing all the reads (both accompanied and non accompanied) 
  shoaling_output$TOT_READS <- shoaling_output$tot_reads_EB + shoaling_output$tot_reads_bottom + 
                                shoaling_output$tot_reads_top + shoaling_output$tot_reads_shelters
  
# I compute my shoaling index combining the four tests    
  shoaling_output$SHOALING <- shoaling_output$ACC_READS/shoaling_output$TOT_READS
    
  

```


I plot the distribution of shoaling index across tests:

```{r}
  
ggplot(data = shoaling_output, aes(SHOALING)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(),
                   bins = 25,
                   fill="#6f7b96",
                   colour = "white") +
    labs(x="Proportion of a time spent with at least one conspecific", y="Count") +
    theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f7f5f5")) +
  xlim(c(0,0.35)) +
  ylim(c(0,50)) + ggtitle("Shoaling tendency across tests")

```




```{r}
ggplot(data = shoaling_output, aes(x = Treatment_seq, y = SHOALING)) +
      geom_violin(fill = "#e4e3e8") + 
      geom_boxplot(fill = "white", width = 0.1, outlier.alpha = 0.3,) +
      theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(colour = "#d4d4d4"),
            panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
            panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour = "#e6e6e6"), 
            axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), 
            axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), 
            panel.background = element_blank(),
            axis.line.y = element_line(color = "black")) +
      labs(y = "Proportion of time with conspecific", x =" ") +
      scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0,NA)) + ggtitle("Shoaling")


```




## 6. Summary of the week

I can first look at the individuals that were never read during the whole week. These individuals could have died, lost their tag, or their tags might be les/non functional. 


```{r, message = FALSE}

# I obtain the name id of the fish that were read in none of the tests
  week1_miss_ind <- Reduce(intersect, list(EB_missing$missing_id,
                       bottom_missing$missing_id,
                       shelter_missing$missing_id,
                       top_missing$missing_id))

# I make it a one column data frame
  week1_miss_ind <- data.frame(id = week1_miss_ind)
# I assign the individuals to their pond
  week1_miss_ind <- merge(week1_miss_ind, list_fish[,c("id", "Pond")], by = "id", all = F)
  print(week1_miss_ind)
```


```{r, message = FALSE}


week1_df <- data.frame(EB_output[c("id", "Treatment_seq", "Pond", "time_since_start")],
                    bottom_output[c("Dist")],
                    shelter_output[c("duration_shelter")],
                    top_output[c("duration_top")],
                    shoaling_output[c("SHOALING")])





```

```{r, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = week1_df, aes(x = duration_shelter, y = duration_top)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + theme_cowplot()
  #coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 100))
  #geom_smooth(colour = "gray")
```



```{r, message = FALSE}

```

```{r, message = FALSE}
