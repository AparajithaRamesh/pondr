# Materials & Methods

**Stickleback Soup**

First, we grinded 200 g of frozen juveniles sticklebacks, corresponding to approximately 1500 individuals, and mixed the resulting paste with 600 mL of tap water. We chose the number of individuals to use in the solution based on established protocols (Cattelan et al., 2020; Evans et al., 2007; Speedie & Gerlai, 2008), and given the important volume of water constituting our pond system. Second, we froze the resulting solution until day of use. Finally, we poured doses of 10 mL per pond during treatment days, corresponding to 0.001 mL of solution per litre of pond water, and to approximately 4 grinded sticklebacks per pond.
